Thank you for visiting my website!

In my free time, I enjoy going fishing.

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of South Florida, graduating Summer 2025. I have over five years of experience in clinical and academic research. My expertise includes clinical trials, statistical programming, data management, and survival analysis. I've collaborated on research involving post-stroke PTSD, atrial fibrillation with micro-bleeds and dementia, HIV and smoking cessation interventions, clinical trial compliance, and music therapy interventions.

I'm a proficient statistical programmer with experience in R, SAS, SPSS, MPLUS, SQL, shell scripts for high-performance computing (HPC), Linux, Qualtrics, and REDCap.I have experience across a wide range of analytical topics including clinical trials, survival analysis, regression, longitudinal analysis, mixed models, SEM/IRT, and Bayesian analysis.

Currently, I have co-authored 5 peer-reviewed publications with 2 more currently under review, including 1 as first author, with a total of 21 citations as of May 24, 2025.

In my free time, I enjoy going fishing and working out at the gym.
