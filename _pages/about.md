Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of South Florida, graduating Summer 2025. I have over five years of experience in clinical and academic research. My expertise includes clinical trials, statistical programming, data management, and survival analysis. I've collaborated on research involving PTSD, neurology, HIV, smoking cessation, and music therapy.

I'm a proficient statistical programmer with experience in R, SAS, SPSS, MPLUS, SQL, shell scripts, Linux, Qualtrics, and REDCap.
I have experience across a wide range of analytical topics including clinical trials, survival analysis, regression, longitudinal analysis, mixed models, SEM/IRT, and Bayesian analysis.

Currently, I have co-authored 5 peer-reviewed publications with 2 more currently under review, including 1 as first author, with a total of 21 citations as of May 24, 2025.

In my free time, I enjoy going fishing.
