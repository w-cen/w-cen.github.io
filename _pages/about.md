Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of South Florida, graduating Summer 2025. I have over five years of experience in clinical and academic research. My expertise includes clinical trials, statistical programming, data management, and complex analysis. I've collaborated on research involving PTSD, neurology, HIV, smoking cessation, and music therapy.

At USF's Study and Design Analysis Team, I work as a biostatistician research assistant supporting faculty on diverse projects, contributing to protocol development, sample size estimation, and analysis using R and SAS. I currently lead statistical support for an NIH R01-funded smoking cessation trial among people living with HIV, managing weekly reports, DSMB deliverables, and CONSORT diagrams. My contributions have resulted in five peer-reviewed publications with two more in review.

Proficient statistical programmer with experience in R, SAS, SPSS, MPLUS, SQL, shell scripts, Linux, Qualtrics and REDCap.
